### What is Rebase tokens?


**Rebase tokens are type of cryptocurrency that have a changing circulating supply, either growing larger (more coins being created/minted) or decreasing (coins get destroyed or 'burnt'), usually to maintain a stable price or achieve a specific target price.**


1. **Traditional tokens**:
    - This have a fixed supply set at the creation of the token. The price of these tokens is determined purely by `market demand and supply dynamics`
  
2. **Rebase tokens**:
    - This are type of crypto-currency. Also called as Elastic token.
    - have a changing circulating supply
    - either growing larger (more coins being created/minted)
    - Or, decreasing (coins get destroyed or 'burnt')
    - can `increase or decrease their supply` automatically!!!



### How Do Rebase Tokens Work?


1. **Target Price & Supply Adjustment**:
   - designed to maintain a `target price` (e.g., $1 per token).
   - If the price goes above the target, `the supply increases` (minting).
   - If the price drops below the target, `the supply decreases` (burning).

2. **Rebasing Mechanism**:
   - At fixed time interval, protocol will check the token price
   - Contract automatically adjusts the total supply of the token depending on the token market price!!!
   - If a rebase reduces supply -> `Users balance decreases`
   - If a rebase increases supply -> `Users balance increases`
   - but their share of the total supply remains the same 


3. **Positive Rebasing**:
   - When the price of token is high relative to its target (say, $1.00) 
   - the protocol automatically increases the supply, distributing more token to all holders proportionally!!!
   - `which theoretically should lower the price`
  
4. **Negative Rebasing**:
   - if the price of token falls below the dollar mark($1)
   - Protocol reducing the number of tokens in each holder's wallet
   - `attempting to increase the price per token`


**Example rebase tokens**:
- Ampleforth (AMPL)
- Yam Finance (YAM)
- Base Protocol (BASE)
- Olympus DAO (OHM)
